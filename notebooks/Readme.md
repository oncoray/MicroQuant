# Notebooks and example scripts

This folder contains ImageJ macro scripts as well as Jupyter notebooks for Python that demonstrate the workflow steps and its implementation for the segmentation, registration and quantification of pairs of H&E and immunofluorescent image data. The input data are required to be in *.czi* file format and need to be processed with both. 

Both [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) and [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows) can be freely installed.
